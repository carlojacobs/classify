# Classify web-app
Classify is a web application that helps students communicate with each other in a structured way. You can make an account, create a class, add students to that class and share information with every student in the class.

## Structure
The web application consists of a front-end that is visible to the user, and a back-end that handles all data traffic between the database and the front-end.
### Back-end
The back-end was built using [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/), a flexible framework that allows you to run `Javascript` on the serverside.
